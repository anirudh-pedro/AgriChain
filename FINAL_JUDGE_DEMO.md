   # Check system health
   query {
     dashboardStats {
       totalUsers
       totalTransactions
       systemHealth
     }
   }

   # Query blockchain data
   query {
     allBlockchainData {
       Key
       Record {
         id
         type
         timestamp
         verified
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### **Phase 4: Blockchain Integration Proof (3 minutes)**
