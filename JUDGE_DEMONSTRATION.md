# AgriChain - Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain Demonstration

## üéØ FOR JUDGES: Live Blockchain Verification

### ‚úÖ Current System Status

- **Frontend**: Running at http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: Running at http://localhost:4000
- **Blockchain**: Live Hyperledger Fabric Network
- **Database**: Connected to MongoDB Atlas

---

## üî• LIVE HYPERLEDGER FABRIC PROOF

### 1. Blockchain Network Status

```bash
docker ps
```

**Expected Output**: 4 running containers

- `orderer-agrichain` (Port 7050) - Blockchain Orderer
- `peer-farmer` (Port 7051) - Farmer Organization
- `peer-distributor` (Port 8051) - Distributor Organization
- `peer-retailer` (Port 9051) - Retailer Organization

### 2. Network Infrastructure

```bash
docker network ls
```

**Shows**: `agrichain_agrichain` network - Dedicated blockchain network

### 3. Live Node Messages

```bash
docker logs orderer-agrichain
docker logs peer-farmer
docker logs peer-distributor
docker logs peer-retailer
```
